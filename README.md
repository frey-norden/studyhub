This is my repo of various web pages with links organized by topic and lists to help streamline my studies.  I have resources that I use frequently here on the different pages so I don't have to hunt for them.
For example, at Haaga-Helia (my university) we have to go to the MyNet, or Moodle, or then to some other web sites to do the assignments. It saves a lot of time to have this persistently laid-out, so that I/you/somebody can just right-click and open the link in a new tab on the browser.

This idea originated from the horoscope page I made to read my daily horoscopes on different sites. It became quite time consuming to do a search for the different pages. So, I just made a page of my own. 
I found this to be pretty convenient. The page was fairly simple to make and employs Bootstrap CSS and JS, making it a responsive web page. I intend to test on mobile devices and further refine the design. For now, though, I wanted to get these uploaded onto github where I can access them easily whether I am at home or on the school's computer system - or any other connected device for that matter. 

##Clone and Enjoy.
